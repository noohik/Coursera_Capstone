    "In this project, I will try to find a candidate for real property investment in **Seoul**, the capital of South Korea. The target of this project is investors who want to find underestimated areas in Seoul.\n",

    "Seoul has **25 districts(\"gu\")** and **467 neighborhoods(\"dong\")**. To characterize each neighborhood, I will use the Foursquare location data. I will try to find a few neighborhoods those have similar characteristics of areas whose public land prices (KRW/square meter) are expensive, but the lands value is relatively cheap. There would be reasons why the land price of neighborhood is cheap, such as bad public transportation, no schools nearby, etc. But I assume that those kind of weak points would be overcome in the future.\n",
